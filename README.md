# Legacy Celery Installer

This is the legacy code for the Celery Installer.

The installer works using a command line interface to allow you to install the Celery executor. It has been open sourced due to concerns of people branding it as malware, when it is not such thing.
You may check the code, you may use it how you want, or how you like, just follow the License. Thank you.
